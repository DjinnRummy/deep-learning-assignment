# Deep Learning Assignment â€“ Tierra Gipson
# CIS-2532-NET02
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks completed as part of the Deep Learning assignment for CIS-2532-NET02. The exercises are based on tutorials by Joseph Lee and were modified and annotated by Tierra Gipson to demonstrate understanding of foundational deep learning concepts and model implementation using Keras.

## Contents

### Part 1: Predicting House Prices with Keras
- File: `Coding Companion for Intuitive Deep Learning Part 1 Annotated.ipynb`
- Description: A fully annotated walkthrough of a simple feedforward neural network that predicts house prices based on features like square footage and number of bedrooms.
- Dataset: `housepricedata.csv`

### Part 2: Image Classification with CNNs
- File: `Coding Companion to Intuitive Deep Learning Part 2.ipynb`
- Description: A convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, demonstrating key layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, and Dense layers.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Anaconda or create a virtual environment
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook
3. Ensure the following Python packages are installed:
   - keras
   - tensorflow
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
